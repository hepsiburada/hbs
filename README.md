# Lembas

```
"Eat little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes
will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought
them. One will keep a traveler on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall men of
Minas Tirith."
```
